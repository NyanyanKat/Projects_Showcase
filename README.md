## 1 About

Present all my projects in style with a super customizable web app! âœ¨

`Projects` uses the GitHub API to list all your GitHub projects in a nice searchable grid.
Also shows pretty programming icons using `devicons`.

The site should be live on <a href="https://github.com/NyanyanKat/Projects_Showcase">Live Demo</a>


#### 2 Programming Language Icons

This project uses [Devicon](https://devicon.dev/) for adding language icons, if the language name and icon are not being
displayed correctly for any of your repos, update `devicons` mapping in `script.js`.


## 3 How it was built

Projects was built using `HTML` `CSS` & `JavaScript`.
It was built on Neovim and the python http server.
Uses GitHub API for data and Devicons for programming icons.
